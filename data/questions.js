        explanation: "XSS lets attackers run arbitrary JavaScript in victims' browsers. Output encoding prevents this; always sanitise and encode user data before rendering."
    },
    {
        id: 37,
        question: "Your organisation's SIEM alerts on 10,000 failed login attempts in 5 minutes from a single IP. What attack is most likely?",

        id: 40,
        question: "You receive an HTTPS link in a chat message. The padlock icon is green. Is the site definitely safe?",
        correct: "No — HTTPS only encrypts transit; the site itself could still be malicious or phishing",
        incorrect: "Yes — a padlock means the site is legitimate and secure",
        explanation: "Attackers routinely obtain valid TLS certificates for phishing domains. HTTPS means your connection is encrypted, not that the destination is trustworthy."
    },
    {
        id: 41,
        question: "Your app stores user session tokens in localStorage. Why is this a security risk?",
        correct: "Any JavaScript on the page (including XSS payloads) can read localStorage and steal session tokens",
        incorrect: "localStorage is encrypted by the browser and therefore safe",
        explanation: "localStorage is accessible to all scripts on the page. Prefer HttpOnly cookies for session tokens so JavaScript cannot access them."
    },
    {
        id: 42,
        question: "An attacker intercepts and replays an older valid API request to perform an unauthorised action. What control would have prevented this?",
        correct: "Request signing with a timestamp or nonce to ensure each request is unique and time-limited",
        incorrect: "Using HTTPS would have prevented the replay",
        explanation: "Replay attacks reuse captured legitimate requests. Nonces and short-lived timestamps invalidate replayed requests even if the payload was originally valid."
    },
    {
        id: 43,
        question: "Your company uses a third-party analytics library hosted on an external CDN. What supply-chain risk does this introduce?",
        correct: "If the CDN or library is compromised, malicious code runs in every user's browser",
        incorrect: "External CDNs are monitored by internet authorities and are always safe",
        explanation: "Supply-chain attacks (e.g. SolarWinds, Polyfill.io) insert malicious code into trusted third-party assets. Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes to verify scripts."
    },
    {
        id: 44,
        question: "A server error page exposes a full stack trace including database connection strings. Why is this critical?",
        correct: "Attackers gain exact knowledge of your tech stack, file paths, and potentially credentials — hide all error details in production",
        incorrect: "Stack traces are only visible to authenticated users so it is low risk",
        explanation: "Information disclosure accelerates attacks. Production error pages should show only generic messages; log details server-side securely."
    },
    {
        id: 45,
        question: "You are asked to review a new feature that stores encrypted credit card numbers in the database. The team uses MD5 for encryption. What is wrong?",
        correct: "MD5 is a hash function, not encryption — it is also cryptographically broken and must never be used for sensitive data",
        incorrect: "MD5 is a strong algorithm and is fine for storing payment data",
        explanation: "MD5 is irreversible (a hash, not encryption) and is trivially broken. Payment data requires strong authenticated encryption (AES-256-GCM) and PCI-DSS compliance."
